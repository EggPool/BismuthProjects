# Welcome to the Bismuth autogame tutorial

## What is autogame:

Autogame is a **deterministic semi-autonomous** computer game with RPG elements everyone in
possession of Bismuth can participate in. Without a central server, everyone can reproduce
game world events based on predefined rules for every match. Changing the rules changes 
outcomes of matches.

Users enter the world by sending a **specific transaction to the Bismuth blockchain**, 
that's where their journey begins. The autogame world is unknowingly generated by the Bismuth
miners and is shared among all players. That includes encounters of monsters, healing 
and weapon/armor looting.

So if two players enter on the same block height, they will meet the same enemies and obtain
same weapons and armor. However, encounters will evolve differently, based on their **addresses,
which are used as match seeds.**

Progress in the world is linear, block by block and transaction by transaction. 
Each transaction generates a random game step hash. The game then cycles through the hashes,
looking for patterns. Certain patterns trigger events. Each game ultimately ends in player's death. 
**The player who survives the longest takes the top spot in the highscores table.**

## Participation:

### Casual league:
You can participate by sending a random Bismuth transaction to anyone, but you **must include 
"autogame" as the transaction operation.** That will automatically include you in the casual
league.

|Data|Operation|Recipient|Amount|Effect|
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|None|autogame|_any_|_any_|Starts a match in the casual league.|

### Tournaments:
Tournaments require you to send a specific amount to a specific address of the tournament 
coordinator. You **must include "autogame" as the transaction operation and enter the tournament 
name in the "data" field.** If you do it correctly, you will be automatically included in 
the league.

|Data|Operation|Recipient|Amount|Effect|
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|_Tournament name_|autogame|_Tournament coordinator address_|_Tournament fee_|Starts a match in a given tournament, fabulous prizes to be won.

### Human interaction:

- They can **grant themselves items**, currently **The Chaos Ring**, which can give them a **positive
blessing or a negative curse** based on the structure of the current step in the world.

- They can summon global events that happen across all leagues for all players, currently 
**Ragnarök, which adds new types of enemies to the currently running matches.**

|Data|Operation|Amount|Effect|
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|item:chaos_ring|autogame:add|_any_|Adds Chaos Ring to the ongoing match of the given address.
|event:ragnarok|autogame:add|_any_|Introduces the Ragnarök event to all currently running matches across all leagues.|



## Game progress:
Progress of individual matches can be tracked online in real time at 
http://autogame.bismuth.live:6060 or you can run your own instance of the **game engine (run.py)**
and the **webserver (web.py)** available in this repository. You will need to specify path
to the running Bismuth blockchain in **config.json**
